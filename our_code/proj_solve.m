% Helper function to run projected steepest descent SDP solver on given 
% inputs
% Input: 
% - A: anchor locations 
% - D: distance matrix 
% - M: matrix indicating which i, j pairs for which distance is known
% - d: dimensionality of problem 
% - n_sensors: number of sensors 
% - n_anchors: number of anchors
% Output:
% - Z: reconstructed sensor locations
function Z = proj_solve(A, D, M, d, n_sensors, n_anchors)
