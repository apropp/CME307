% Helper function to run SOCP relaxation solver on given inputs
% Input: 
% - A: anchor locations 
% - D: distance matrix 
% - M: matrix indicating which i, j pairs for which distance is known
% Output:
% - Z: reconstructed sensor locations
function Z = nll_solve(A, D, M, d, n_sensors, n_anchors)
end
